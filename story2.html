        the georgia guidestones in the usa  on theses pillow or slabs of rock  there is a scriptur <br><br>
        on it not in only one language but  eight modern languages <br><br>
        The monument stands at an approximate elevation of 750 feet (230 m) above sea level,<br><br>
         about 90 miles (140 km)<br><br>
         east of Atlanta, 45 miles (72 km) from Athens, Georgia<br><br>

                within this scriptur  it says <br><br>
Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.<br><br>
Guide reproduction wisely—improving fitness and diversity.<br><br>
Unite humanity with a living new language.<br><br>
Rule passion—faith—tradition—and all things with tempered reason.<br><br>
Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.<br><br>
Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.<br><br>
Avoid petty laws and useless officials.<br><br>
Balance personal rights with social duties.<br><br>
Prize truth—beauty—love—seeking harmony with the infinite.<br><br>
Be not a cancer on the Earth—Leave room for nature—Leave room for nature.<br><br>
